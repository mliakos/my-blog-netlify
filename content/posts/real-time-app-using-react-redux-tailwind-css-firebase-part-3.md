Previously in [part 2](https://blog.manos-liakos.dev/real-time-scrum-voting-app-part-2), we did all the hard work of setting up **Redux** & **Firebase**, plus creating and connecting our **first component.** In this part, we are going to add the initial user functionality by assigning a default, random username when first visiting the app and also being able to edit it.

- - -

As per the requirements laid out in the [first part](https://blog.manos-liakos.dev/real-time-scrum-voting-app-part-1):

* *Each client gets assigned aÂ **default random username**Â when first visiting the app which he can also refresh.*
* Any participant canÂ **edit his/her username**, as well as theÂ **feature-to-be-implemented title**.

So, let's go and see what we can do! ðŸš€ðŸš€

# **Heading component**

## Setting up

The `Heading` component is going to host the application title, as well as the `UserName` component itself. Inside the `components` folder create a `Heading` folder and add two more things:

* A `UserName` folder, which is going to hold the relevant component.
* A `Heading.js` file.

A visual reminder of what we are building:

![scrum-voting-app](/media/voting-app-components.png "Scrum voting app layout")

We are also going to create three utility functions to make local storage manipulation easier throughout the app. Inside the `utils` folder create three files named `getLocalStorage.js`, `setLocalStorage.js` and `removeLocalStorage.js` and paste the following functions, to each one respectively:

```javascript
// getLocalStorage.js

const getLocalStorage = key => {
	return JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem(key));
};

export default getLocalStorage;
```

```javascript
// setLocalStorage

const setLocalStorage = ({ key, value }) => {
	localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
};

export default setLocalStorage;
```

```javascript
// removeLocalStorage

const removeLocalStorage = key => {
	localStorage.removeItem(key);
};

export default removeLocalStorage;
```



## Creating Heading component

Import our `UserName` component (which we are going to implement right after) and place it inside the  `Heading`, along with a simple title for our app and some styles. Paste the following code inside the `Heading.js` file:

```javascript
import UserName from "./UserName";

const Heading = () => {
	return (
		<div className="md:flex md:items-center md:justify-between">
			<div className="flex-1 min-w-0">
				<h2 className="text-2xl font-bold leading-7 text-gray-900 sm:text-3xl">
					Scrum Voting App
				</h2>
			</div>
			<div className="mt-10 flex md:mt-0 md:ml-4 justify-center">
				<div>
					<UserName />
				</div>
			</div>
		</div>
	);
};

export default Heading;
```

## Creating UserName component

Under `components/Heading/UserName` create an `index.js` file and add the following code:

```javascript
// Generic Input component we also used for FeatureTitle
import Input from "../../Input/Input"; 

import { useDispatch, useSelector } from "react-redux";
import { useEffect } from "react";

// Redux action/thunks
import updateUser from "../../../store/actions/users/updateUser";

// Simple utility to retrieve and parse values from local storage
import getLocalStorage from "../../../utils/getLocalStorage";
import createDefaultUser from "../../../common/createDefaultUser";

const UserName = () => {
	const dispatch = useDispatch();
	const state = useSelector(state => state.users);

	const currentUserId = getLocalStorage("userId");
  
  // Default user creation handling
	useEffect(() => {
		// Create a user if none exists
		if (currentUserId === null) createDefaultUser(dispatch);
	}, [dispatch, currentUserId]);

    // Retrieve current user using saved id from local storage
	const user = state.users.find(user => Object.keys(user)[0] === currentUserId);

	const handleUserUpdate = event => {
        // Action payload (updated user object)
		const updatedUser = {
			id: currentUserId,
			data: {
				...user[currentUserId],
				username: event.target.value
			}
		};

		dispatch(updateUser(updatedUser));
	};

	return (
		<Input
			label="Username"
			placeholder="Type a username..."
			handleChange={event => handleUserUpdate(event)}
            // While loading display a loading message, else display current user
			value={user ? user[currentUserId].username : "Loading username..."}
			name="username"
			className="inline-flex items-center px-4 py-2 border border-transparent rounded-md shadow-sm text-sm font-medium focus:outline-none focus:ring-2 focus:ring-offset-2 focus:ring-indigo-500"
			// Disable editing while loading
            disabled={user ? false : true}
		/>
	);
};

export default UserName;
```

I have placed some comments to make things easier to grasp. We basically add an `Input` component, which will a have a dual role: Displaying our current username and changing it.

## Crafting the state

Let's go ahead and create anything state-related to **add** and **update** users.

### Constants

Under `store/constants` create a file named `users.js`. It will contain all the **action constants** for the user slice.

For now, we only want `ADD`, `UPDATE` and `REVERT` functionality, so go ahead and add those three constants:

```javascript
export const ADD_USER = "ADD_USER";
export const UPDATE_USER = "UPDATE_USER";
export const SET_USERS = "SET_USERS"; // This is going to be used for state reversion
```

### Actions

Under `store/actions` create a folder named `users`. It will hold all user-related actions. First, we are going to create an action to **add** a user, so go ahead and create a file named `addUser.js`. Then paste the following code:

```javascript
// Firebase module to add user
import firebaseAddUser from "../../../firebase/users/addUser";
import setLocalStorage from "../../../utils/setLocalStorage";

const addUser = payload => (dispatch, getState, getFirebase) => {
    // Get firebase object
	const firebase = getFirebase();
	const state = getState();

    // Username of the new user
	const { username: value } = payload;

    // Get old state (used to revert in case of error)
	const {
		users: { users: oldState }
	} = state;

    // Pass necessary data to our firebase module
	const config = {
		ref: "users/", // Firebase reference to perform query on
		payload,
		oldState,
		firebase,
		dispatch
	};

    // Update local storage with the username to create persistency
	setLocalStorage({ key: "username", value });

    // Add user to firebase
	firebaseAddUser(config);
};

export default addUser;
```

What we just created above is called a **thunk** which, as we stated [here in the previous part](https://blog.manos-liakos.dev/real-time-scrum-voting-app-part-2#redux-thunk), is basically an **enhanced action** which returns a **function** instead of an **object**. Inside this function we can run any **asynchronous code** we want, as well as **dispatch other actions.** Notice how `dispatch`, `getState`and `getFirebase`methods are provided as arguments to our action by the **thunk middleware.**

Once again, I hope that the comments help explain what's going on above. We are doing two main things here:

* Creating a config object to pass to `firebaseAddUser` (which is called asynchronously).
* Persist username to local storage. This is going to be useful in order to getting the user identified correctly and not create a new one each time he visits the app on the same browser (provided he doesn't clear the local storage).

Also, notice how we are not dispatching any action to update the state. The reason is that there can be no change in the UI state (and thus a visual change), **until we get a response from the database.** It's also an **automatic** and **one-time procedure**, while the result is stored in local storage, so no Redux persistence is needed.

Similarly, let's create the action to **update** a user. Again, under the `actions` directory create a file named `updateUser.js` and paste the following code:

```javascript
import { UPDATE_USER } from "../../constants/users";

// Firebase module to update user
import firebaseUpdateUser from "../../../firebase/users/updateUser";

const updateUser = ({ id, data }) => (dispatch, getState, getFirebase) => {
	const firebase = getFirebase();
	const state = getState();

    // Grab user object form state (used to revert in case of error)
	const [oldState] = state.users.users.filter(user => user[id]);

	const config = {
		ref: `users/${id}`, // Firebase reference to perform query on
		payload: data,
		oldState,
		firebase,
		dispatch,
		resetActionType: UPDATE_USER
	};

    // Update user record in firebase
	firebaseUpdateUser(config);

	// Dispatch asynchronously to maintain a responsive UI
	dispatch({
		type: UPDATE_USER,
		payload: {
			[id]: data
		}
	});
};

export default updateUser;
```

Some notes:

* Regarding the `ref` property usage you can check the [Firebase Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/reference/node/firebase.database.Reference). Basically, it's a "path" used to specify the **location** in our database, upon which the query is going to execute.
* Regarding the two custom firebase modules, `firebaseAddUser` and `firebaseUpdateUser`, we are going to create them right after finishing with the reducers below.
* The reason why we are specifying the `resetActionType` is because later on, we are going to be using a different reducer when resetting the state, based on whether we are **updating a single user** or **resetting the votes for every user.**
* In contrast to the `addUser` action, here we are dispatching an action to update the state which happens **asynchronously and independently of the Firebase update, in order to maintain a responsive UI.**

### Reducers

Under `store/reducers` create a `users.js` file to create our users reducers. Then paste the following:

```javascript
import * as actionTypes from "../constants/users";

const initState = {
	users: []
};

const usersReducer = (state = initState, action) => {
	switch (action.type) {
		case actionTypes.ADD_USER: {
			return {
				...state,
				users: [...state.users, action.payload]
			};
		}

		case actionTypes.UPDATE_USER: {
			return {
				...state,
				users: state.users.map(user => {
					/*
					 * Grab IDs
					 */
					const [stateUserId] = Object.keys(user);
					const [payloadUserId] = Object.keys(action.payload);

					// Return the same user object if IDs don't match
					if (stateUserId !== payloadUserId) return user;

					// Else replace objet and update user
					return action.payload;
				})
			};
		}

		case actionTypes.SET_USERS:
			return {
				...state,
				users: action.payload // Replace the whole users array
			};

		default:
			return state;
	}
};

export default usersReducer;
```

Don't forget to also combine the new reducer with the root one. Make sure that `store/reducers/index.js` looks like this:

```javascript
import { combineReducers } from "redux";
import feature from "./feature";
import users from "./users"; // <-- New line

export default combineReducers({
	feature,
	users // <-- New line
});
```

# Adding Firebase persistence

## Push updates to Firebase

Now we have to persist our Redux data to Firebase, just as we did in the previous part for the `FeatureTitle` component. Under `src/firebase` create a `users` folder and add a `addUser.js` file. Then paste the following code:

```javascript
import { SET_USERS } from "../../store/constants/users";

const addUser = ({ ref, payload, oldState, firebase, dispatch }) => {
	firebase
		.ref(ref) // Select ref to update
		.push(payload) // Push the new user
  
        // Handle error
		.catch(e => {
			// Revert to old state in case of error
			dispatch({
				type: SET_USERS,
				payload: oldState
			});
           
            /* 
            * Dispatch snackbar with our browser's
            * built-in, sophisticated notification system ðŸ˜Ž
            */
			alert("There was an error performing the request.");
		});
};

export default addUser;
```

The above code will handle the persistence of any new user that gets added to the database. To persist any updates made, add the following action in a file named `updateUser.js`:

```javascript
import debounce from "../../utils/debounce";

const updateUser = ({
	ref,
	payload,
	oldState,
	firebase,
	dispatch,
	resetActionType
}) => {
	firebase
		.ref(ref)
		.set(payload)
		.then(error => {
			// Revert to old state in case of error
			if (error) {
				dispatch({
					type: resetActionType,
					payload: oldState
				});

				/*
				 * Dispatch snackbar with our browser's
				 * built-in, sophisticated notification system ðŸ˜Ž
				 */
				alert("There was an error performing the request.");
			}
		});
};

export default debounce(updateUser, 500);
```

The logic is very similar here, except that we are also debouncing the action, since it is tied to manual user typing and can very well be spammed.

## Receive updates from Firebase

Same as with the `FeatureTitle` component from the previous part, we need to setup the appropriate listeners in order to successfully receive updates from Firebase and update our Redux store. Inside `store/actions/users` folder the we have created, add a new file named `setupFirebaseListeners.js`. The code inside this file is going to do exactly that: Setup the appropriate listeners in order to subscribe to updates from Firebase.

```javascript
import { ADD_USER, UPDATE_USER } from "../../constants/users";

import getLocalStorage from "../../../utils/getLocalStorage";
import setLocalStorage from "../../../utils/setLocalStorage";

const setupUsersListener = () => (dispatch, getState, getFirebase) => {
	const firebase = getFirebase();
	const usersRef = firebase.database().ref("users");

	/* User updates handling */
	usersRef.on("child_changed", snapshot => {
		const { key } = snapshot;

		// Update state
		dispatch({
			type: UPDATE_USER,
			payload: {
				[key]: snapshot.val()
			}
		});
	});

	/* Users loading and new user handling */
	usersRef.on("child_added", snapshot => {
		const user = snapshot.val(); // get user object
		const { username } = user;
		const { key } = snapshot; // user ID

		if (username === getLocalStorage("username")) {
			// Save user id in local storage if it matches own username
			setLocalStorage({ key: "userId", value: key });
		}

		// Update state
		dispatch({
			type: ADD_USER,
			payload: {
				[key]: user
			}
		});
	});
};

export default setupUsersListener;
```

The thunk we created above is going to be dispatched once on application start and listeners for the relevant Firebase events are going to be registered. Import the action and dispatch it inside `App.js`:

```javascript
import "./App.css";

import FeatureTitle from "../components/FeatureTitle";

import { useDispatch } from "react-redux";
import { useEffect } from "react";

import setupFeatureListeners from "../store/actions/feature/setupFirebaseListeners";
import setupUsersListeners from "../store/actions/users/setupFirebaseListeners"; // <--- New line

function App() {
	const dispatch = useDispatch();

	// Setting up listeners
	useEffect(() => {
		dispatch(setupUsersListeners()); // <--- New line
		dispatch(setupFeatureListeners());
	}, [dispatch]);

	return (
		<main className="max-w-7xl mx-auto my-5 px-4 sm:px-6 lg:px-8">
			<div className="flex flex-col flex-wrap max-w-3xl mx-auto mt-10">
				<div className="flex justify-center">
					<FeatureTitle />
				</div>
			</div>
		</main>
	);
}

export default App;
```

That's it! Run `npm start`, visit `localhost:3000` (or whatever port you are using) and you should be able to see a default username assigned on the top right corner. Try editing it on both your browser and firebase and make sure that the two are synced. If you try to open the app in Incognito mode, you are going to get assigned a new user, because of a clean local storage.
