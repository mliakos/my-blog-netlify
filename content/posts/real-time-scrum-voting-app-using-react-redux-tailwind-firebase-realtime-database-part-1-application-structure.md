Hi all, this is part 1 of a multi-part series, in which we are going to build a real-time scrum voting app using some of the hottest frontend technologies! ðŸ˜Ž

# **Stack**

* **React & Redux** for state management
* **Tailwind CSS** for quick and effortless styling
* **Firebase Realtime Database** for storage

# Requirements

The goal is to implement a web application that will be used by a remote scrum team, during their sprint planning session, to privately vote on the complexity score of a single story (task/feature to be implemented).

* Full-fledged real-time implementation: All changes will happen in real-time and will be immediately visible to everyone.
* Each client gets assigned a default random username when first visiting the app which he can also refresh.
* Any participant can edit his/her username, as well as the feature-to-be-implemented title.
* Any participant can vote and reveal all votes, effectively ending the session.
* While votes are hidden, any participant that has voted gets a "Voted!" message next to his/her username.
* When votes are revealed, users get reordered based on their votes. After that, anyone is able to reset the session, clearing all votes and resetting the feature title.

## End result

Phew, that seemed quite overwhelming ðŸ¤¯. This project was part of a code challenge, so don't put the blame on me ðŸ˜‚ Anyway, let's get down to it.
